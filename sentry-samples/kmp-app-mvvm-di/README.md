# Sentry KMP Demo App

This is a demo app for the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK that includes a native iOS app and a native Android app with shared code.

## Shared Features
 - Dependency Injection with Koin
 - ViewModels
 - Sentry Setup

## Getting Started

### IDE

Install the [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile) for Android Studio.

You can use Android Studio to run both the Android and iOS sample apps.

The android target is available as `sentry-samples.kmp-app-mvvm-di.androidApp` automatically.
The iOS target needs to be configured: add a new run configuration and select an iOS application as a new target.
You can then select the `iosApp.xcworkspace` file for the required `Xcode project file`.

### Android
- Export your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable if you haven't done already.
- You can run `./gradlew :sentry-samples:kmp-app:androidApp:assembleDebug` to compile the Android app.

### iOS

#### Cocoapods
You need Cocoapods installed on your machine.

Run `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8` to avoid encoding issues.

`pod install` will automatically run through gradle if you run the iOS app through Android Studio.
However, you can still run `pod install` on the iOS folder manually if you want to make sure the pods are up to date.

#### DSYMS
First you need to have `sentry-cli` installed.

Then add the following script to your `Build Phases` in Xcode and change the `org`, `project`, `auth_token` slug placeholders accordingly:
Make sure to change the placeholders correctly, otherwise the iOS app will not run.

```shell
if which sentry-cli >/dev/null; then
export SENTRY_ORG=<org_slug>
export SENTRY_PROJECT=<project_slug>
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<auth_token>
ERROR=$(sentry-cli upload-dif "$DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH" 2>&1 >/dev/null)
if [ ! $? -eq 0 ]; then
echo "warning: sentry-cli - $ERROR"
fi
else
echo "warning: sentry-cli not installed, download from https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases"
fi
```

### Sentry Setup
If you need to change the `DSN` or any options you can do so in the `SentrySetup.kt` file in the `shared` module.
