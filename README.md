    <h1>Experimental Sentry SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform</h1>
</p>

This project is an experimental SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform.
This SDK is a wrapper around different platforms such as JVM, Android, iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS that can be used on Kotlin Multiplatform.

## Supported Platforms

 - JVM
 - Android
 - iOS
 - macOS
 - watchOS
 - tvOS

## Configure Repository

The Kotlin Multiplatform SDK is available in the Maven central repository. You can declare this repository in your build script as follows:

```gradle
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
```

## Add dependency
For a multiplatform project, you need to add the sentry-kotlin-multiplatform artifact to the `commonMain` source set:

```Kotlin
val commonMain by getting {
  dependencies {
    api("io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-multiplatform:0.0.1")
  }
}
```

### Cocoa

For iOS, MacOS, tvOS or watchOS we use CocoaPods to include [sentry-cocoa](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa) into this SDK.
One way to achieve this is to include the Sentry Cocoa SDK via the Kotlin CocoaPods extension.

```gradle
cocoapods {
  // ...
  
  // Make sure this is the same version as the one used in the SDK
  pod("Sentry", "~> 7.21.0")

  framework {
    baseName = "shared"

    // Export the SDK in order to be able to access it directly in the iOS project
    export("io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-multiplatform:0.0.1")
  }
}
```

## Initialization

Remember to execute the initialization as early in your application life cycle as possible.

### Android

```Kotlin
class YourApplication : Application() {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
      Sentry.init(this) {
        it.dsn = "___DSN___"
      }
   }
}
```

### iOS
Ideally you will call this in `applicationDidFinishLaunching` in AppDelegate or in `init` in your SwiftUI App

```Swift
import shared

// ...

Sentry().start { options in 
  options.dsn = "___DSN___"
}
```

## Debug Symbols for Apple targets

A dSYM upload is required for Sentry to symbolicate your crash logs for viewing. The symbolication process unscrambles Appleâ€™s crash logs to reveal the function, variables, file names, and line numbers of the crash. The dSYM file can be uploaded through the sentry-cli tool or through a Fastlane action. Please visit our [sentry.io guide](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/cocoa/dsym/) to get started on uploading debug symbols.

 ## Troubleshooting

 `WARNING: CocoaPods requires your terminal to be using UTF-8 encoding.
    Consider adding the following to ~/.profile:
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`

  This is a known problem and can easily be fixed as described in this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69395720)
